Facial Analysis and Object Detection System with AWS Integration
This project is a cloud-native system for real-time facial analysis and object detection, utilizing a suite of AWS services to ensure scalability, speed, and automation. The system analyzes images for specific facial expressions and objects, triggering alerts when certain conditions are met.

Key Features
•	Real-Time Facial Analysis and Object Detection: Uses Amazon Rekognition to analyze facial expressions and detect objects, allowing for rapid identification and categorization.

•	Automated Workflow with AWS Lambda and SQS: Processes incoming image data using AWS Lambda, with SQS handling task queuing to ensure efficient processing at scale.

•	Data Storage and Retrieval: Stores image data in Amazon S3 and metadata in DynamoDB, enabling seamless access and management of large datasets.

•	Alert Notifications with SNS: Sends alerts via SNS based on predefined facial expression criteria, allowing for quick responses to critical events.

•	Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with CloudFormation: Automates the deployment and management of resources using CloudFormation, making the system replicable and easy to maintain.

This AWS-powered solution offers a robust, automated approach to facial analysis and object detection, ideal for applications requiring real-time insights and responsive alerts.
